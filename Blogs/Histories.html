          <h3>Anient Greek Cults</h3>
          <p>
            In 521 BC, the Dionysus Degenerates got into a heated argument with the Absolute Athenacolytes just outside what is now Athens
            <br>The Athena Admirers accused the Dionysians of draconian devolution into drink and drugs, of setting artistic advancement alight, and of destroying the altruistic decorum of affable democracy with abhorrent disdain.
            <br>The Dionyphiles disagreed. They argued that drawing distinctions between angelic acts and divine debauchery only dehumanized the downtrodden, who aspired to live freely and simply in their humble abodes.
            <br>As tempers flared, rhetoric gave way to raw emotion. Arguments turned to accusations, and soon both sides were shouting over one another. When one Dianopheliac accused the Athenamorists of being a cult, all Hades broke loose. It became a full-blown screaming match, neither side yielding an inch.
            <br><br><i>
                “You’re a cult!”<br>
                “No, you’re a cult!”<br>
                “UR A CULT!”<br>
                “Uraculturaculturaculturaculturaculturacult—”<br>
            </i><br>
            When the sun finally set, the Athenians returned home, livid and humiliated. Yet, in their outrage, a spark of inspiration struck: if being called a cult was so shameful, perhaps it could be transformed—refined, repurposed—into something admirable.
            <br><br>
            And that, my friends, is how the Greeks invented culture.
