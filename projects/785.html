        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Presenting RLFinNet, a novel reinforcement learning-based model tailored for the efficient and rapid forecasting of financial time-series data. Focused on the specific 
            dynamics of individual company stock prices, RLFinNet addresses the need for models that are not only accurate but also quick to adapt to new data, avoiding the influence of 
            irrelevant market factors, but crucially not ignoring them. Our approach enhances the classical deep reinforcement learning framework by incorporating an innovative dual forecasting model, adapted from the 
            <a href = "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/dd6a47bc0aad6f34aa5e77706d90cdc4-Abstract-Conference.html" target="_blank">OneNet</a> architecture, which 
            leverages both cross-time and cross-variable dependencies to predict future stock prices effectively.

    <!-- Project Goals -->
    <section class="project-goals">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>RLFinNet’s design builds on the existing OneNet architecture but has been streamlined and tailored for stock forecasting needs.</li>
            <li>The model prioritizes key information, especially the adjusted closing price, which reflects a stock’s final value each trading day.</li>
            <li>I rewrote the existing OneNet model to be more lightweight and streamline the input dimensions, weighing the adjusted close price which I considered the most important.</li>
            <li>The lightweight design is particularly beneficial for smaller trading platforms or institutions with limited computational capacity.

        <h2>Potetial Industrial Applications</h2>
        <p>
            RLFinNet has strong potential for use in the finance industry, particularly for real-time stock market forecasting and financial analytics. Its ability to quickly adapt to new data 
            makes it suitable for high-frequency trading environments where timely predictions are crucial. The model could be applied to portfolio management, helping investors make informed 
            decisions by predicting market trends more efficiently. Additionally, RLFinNet could be useful in risk management by identifying volatility patterns and aiding in the mitigation of 
            financial risks. Its lightweight design also opens possibilities for integration into smaller financial institutions or trading platforms with limited computational resources.
