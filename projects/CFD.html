        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, My teammates and I developed a conceptual design for an inert gas flow chamber intended for additive manufacturing environments. 
            The objective was to create an optimized chamber geometry that enhances spatter removal, maintains thermal stability, and ensures a controlled atmosphere. 
            Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), I refined the design by analyzing gas flow patterns and heat transfer effects.

        <h2>Analysis Methods</h2>
        <p>
            We quantitatively classified gas flow configurations to identify the most effective setup. Any configuration where the average gas speed over a 0.1 m space above the build plate was below 2 m/s was considered inadequate for clearing spatter. Our analysis revealed that placing the inlet near the bottom (0.0 - 0.1 m) and the outlet near the top (0.3 - 0.4 m) provided the best results. This setup achieved an average gas speed of 2.5 m/s, ensuring spatter removal while minimizing temperature loss. With only a 5% reduction in the thermal profile and 90% of the build plate maintaining optimal temperature, this configuration offered the best balance of flow and heat retention.

        <h2>Visualizing results</h2>
        <p>
            The chamber design was iteratively refined through simulation-driven analysis. Key modifications were made to the inlet and 
            outlet positioning to enhance airflow efficiency. Below are results from CFD simulations evaluating the effectiveness of the design.

        <h2>Results and Insights</h2>
        <p>
            The analysis provided key insights that informed the chamber design:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Improved Spatter Control:</strong> The optimized flow reduced particle accumulation by 30%.</li>
            <li><strong>Thermal Stability:</strong> Modifying the flow rate and nozzle positioning led to more consistent heat retention.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Gas Flow Efficiency:</strong> Reducing eddy formations resulted in smoother gas distribution.</li>
        </ul>
